Research Overview:
My research involves collecting and managing ~1 TB of continuous acoustic data from ~20 field sites to answer the question: Can audible and infrasound be used to infer changes in stream discharge? Scientific computing is a critical part of this project, as I depend on Linux to manage data and Python for analysis. This project is a large-scale observational study, so writing software that works well for any set of acoustic data really helps save processing time. Additionally, I would like to apply machine learning techniques to attempt to characterize unique acoustic signals from a large set of data. 



Goals:

1. Gain confidence in git, enough to create branch on an existing project with only my code by October.
2. Become comfortable writing code in VScode (Jupyter) IDE and utilizing all features by October.
3. Gain understanding of writing functions that regularly pull data by the end of the semester.
